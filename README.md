## General Information
When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:
* If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
* If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company
 
## Project Statement
Find the driving factors which lead to the defaulted loans which are major source of loss for the company.

## Data Set
The data set is a csv file with the loan data for the Lending Club.
